# Tic Tac Toe Game
Advanced task for [Game #4 AI Strategy](https://github.com/ChaseBENNC9/ChessAIStrat) in Intro to algorithmic problem solving
Refactored the Minimax script from the AI Strategy to work in a game of tic tac toe.

## Known Issues
- Shuffle Method randomizing all moves instead of first, removed for now needs better implementation.
- Sometimes it's still possible for the Player to win, with the correct implementation of minimax this should not happen\

## Note
[Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/) was used as a guide for creating the minimax algorithm for tic tac toe. I asked it to use the chess minimax script as a guide and give me an idea of how to work with it using tic tac toe with my existing scripts. I later incorporated alpha beta pruning and the shuffle method from the chess game.
